This is an overlay for Yocto/Angstoem on the Toradex Apalis T30 board.
It contains the Aravis video capture plugin for GStreamer 0.10.

It is based on the 'meta-product' layer by Toradex.
===============================================================================

meta-product demonstrates how one's own custom layer can be used to add
to existing images and thus form an automated build procedure for a 
custom product.

This is additional material to the following article:

This layer requires a working Toradex BSP setup (with meta-toradex),
